Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
==============================

Various Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.

**NOTICE**: Not complete, under gradual development.

## Approach
I have tried to make each example as clear as possible to understand the concepts. Feel free to submit a PR/issue if any concept could be made clearer.

## Data Structures
* [Stacks](Stacks)
  * [Arrays](Stacks/arrays.java)
  * [Linked Lists](Stacks/linkedlist.java)
* [Queues](Queues)
* [Trees](Trees)
* [Graphs](Graphs)
* [Maps](Maps)
* [Tries](Tries)

## Algorithms
  * [Sorts](Sorts)
  * [Bubble Sort](Sorts/bubble.java)
  * [Insertion Sort](Sorts/insertion.java)
  * [Selection Sort](Sorts/selection.java)
  * [Quicksort](Sorts/quicksort.java)
  * [Merge Sort](Sorts/merge.java)

* [Searches](Searches)
  * [Binary Search](Searches/binary.java)
  * [Linear Search](Searches/linear.java)
